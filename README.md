# StatsbyggIOT

This is a PoC-project under Statsbygg summer internship. This is not meant to be a production-scale solution. 

Each use-case uses `sb_sseStream.py` to stream live sensor data from the edge. All use-cases have been developed at their very own branch. Each use-case's logic is described in the top of the source file.

Secrets are not included in the project. Please refer to the project owner for secrets.
